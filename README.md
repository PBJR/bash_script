# Network Trace script
This is a BASH script to print the routing trace from the source to a given destination node. To use the script, it must be uploaded to the desired source node in a given network topology. For the purpose of our project, the desired source node is the "bellman-ford" node. Then run the following on the command line to change the permissions of the script file: ```chmod 755 destination.bash```. And lastly, run the script: ```./destination.bash```. The user will then be prompted to enter a destination node, and once the destination is inputted the script will print the desired output.
